Last year, [Llama 4](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/fine-tuning-llama4-custom-dataset-firecrawl) came out with 10 million tokens of context window. Naturally, people started wondering if that was the end of RAG because the models seem to crush needle-in-a haystack-benchmarks, where information needs to be retrieved from vast amounts of data.

Well, setting aside the fact that Meta [half-cheated in those benchmarks](https://youtu.be/P4M9wfJH-yI?si=eq_QFTWlulN1tC3f), not everybody is going to RAG with Llama 4 family as they don't fit on any consumer GPU.

It's 2026 and RAG is still very much relevant, as it is the best technique to enhance LLM's capabilities regardless of their size and context window. This article explores the top open-source RAG frameworks available today, highlighting their unique features, strengths, and how they can be integrated into your AI applications.

Once you've chosen a framework, optimizing your [chunking strategy](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/best-chunking-strategies-rag) becomes crucial for retrieval performance. For enhanced data retrieval in your RAG pipeline, check out our guide on [MCP servers for Cursor](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/best-mcp-servers-for-cursor) which can provide external data sources. Also see how to prepare website data with our [llms.txt file creation guide](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/How-to-Create-an-llms-txt-File-for-Any-Website).

Before we dive into the most popular open-source RAG frameworks, let's take a moment to discuss [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/).

To build great RAG pipelines, you need high-quality datasets. However, your existing knowledge base may often lack information in certain areas requiring you to enrich it with open web data.

This is where [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/) is your new best friend - it is the best AI-powered scraping engine to collect LLM-friendly web data at scale.

Perhaps, its most useful feature for RAG projects is its [LLMs.txt generation](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/How-to-Create-an-llms-txt-File-for-Any-Website), where Firecrawl dumps entire websites (regardless of their size) into a single text file in a few lines of code:

    from firecrawl import Firecrawl
     
    firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR-API-KEY")
     
    # Scrape a website:
    doc = firecrawl.scrape("https://firecrawl.dev", formats=["markdown", "html"])
    print(doc)

If that't not what you need, Firecrawl offers other features like:

*   [Crawl & scrape method](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/crawl) to traverse websites, converting each page it visits to Markdown for easy LLM consumption
*   [Agent](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/agent) where you describe the data you need and let the AI agent find and extract it for you
*   [Deep research endpoint](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/alpha/deep-research) for adding OpenAI-like deep research capabilities to your RAG pipelines

Each of these methods work with Firecrawl's built-in anti-bot measures and proxy rotation, leaving you to focus on the data collection process itself rather than worrying about the code.

For a practical demonstration of Firecrawl in action, explore our detailed articles that walk through creating custom datasets and building AI applications:

The landscape of RAG frameworks has evolved significantly in 2025, with solutions addressing different aspects of the RAG pipeline from document ingestion to retrieval, generation, and evaluation.

When selecting a framework, consider your specific use case requirements, technical expertise, and deployment constraints. Some frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex offer comprehensive end-to-end solutions, while others like Ragatouille and FlashRAG excel in specific areas such as advanced retrieval techniques or research experimentation. Your choice should align with your application's scale, performance needs, and development timeline.

**What is RAG and why is it still relevant in 2026?**

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhances LLMs by connecting them to external knowledge sources for more accurate, contextual responses. Despite larger context windows in models like Llama 4, RAG remains essential for most applications due to resource constraints and improved accuracy.

**Which RAG framework is best for beginners?**

Dify, LlamaIndex, and txtai offer the lowest barriers to entry. Dify provides a visual interface requiring minimal coding, LlamaIndex has straightforward documentation and examples, while txtai delivers an all-in-one solution with simple installation and comprehensive features.

**Can I use multiple RAG frameworks together?**

Yes, many frameworks are designed to work together. For example, you can use Milvus as your vector database with LangChain or LlamaIndex for orchestration, while adding RAGAS for evaluation. This modular approach lets you combine strengths of different tools.

**How does Firecrawl integrate with RAG frameworks?**

Firecrawl provides high-quality web data collection that works with any RAG framework. It converts websites to LLM-friendly formats, extracts structured information, and enables deep research capabilities. The collected data can then be indexed by your chosen RAG framework for retrieval.

**What's the difference between vector databases and RAG frameworks?**

Vector databases like Milvus store and retrieve embedding vectors efficiently. RAG frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex provide the complete pipeline including document processing, embedding generation, retrieval orchestration, and LLM integration. Most RAG frameworks integrate with multiple vector databases.

**How do I evaluate my RAG system's performance?**

Use RAGAS for comprehensive evaluation with objective metrics measuring context precision, recall, faithfulness, and response relevancy. It also generates test datasets automatically. Most frameworks like LangChain and Haystack include built-in evaluation tools for measuring retrieval and generation quality.

**What hardware requirements do RAG frameworks have?**

Requirements vary significantly. LLMWare and LightRAG can run on standard CPUs and laptops. Frameworks like Milvus handling large-scale vector search benefit from GPUs. Cloud-based solutions like Dify and R2R's SciPhi Cloud eliminate local hardware concerns entirely.

**Can RAG frameworks handle multimodal data?**

Yes, several frameworks support multimodal data. LlamaIndex, txtai, and R2R can process text, images, audio, and video. Milvus stores embeddings from various data types, while RAGFlow excels at extracting information from complex documents including tables and visual elements.

**What's the difference between basic RAG and advanced techniques like GraphRAG?**

Basic RAG retrieves relevant text chunks using vector similarity. GraphRAG creates knowledge graphs from documents to understand entity relationships and context, enabling more sophisticated reasoning. RAGFlow and R2R support GraphRAG approaches for complex query resolution requiring relational understanding.

**How do I deploy RAG applications to production?**

Most frameworks offer Docker deployment for easy scaling. Managed solutions like SciPhi Cloud (R2R) and Dify Cloud eliminate infrastructure concerns. For self-hosting, frameworks like Haystack and LangChain provide production-ready features including monitoring, authentication, and API layers.
